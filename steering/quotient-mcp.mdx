The Quotient MCP server is our synchronous API for steering agent behavior in real-time and in production using models we develop.

Quotient MCP is available as a remote Streamable HTTP server at [https://mcp.quotientai.co/mcp/](https://mcp.quotientai.co/mcp/)

# Tools

## `evaluate_tool_call`

Evaluates whether an AI agent correctly used available tools in a conversation context.

**Parameters:**
- `available_tools`: Array of tool definitions with schemas
- `message_history`: Array of conversation messages

**Returns:**
- `score`: `"correct"`, `"incorrect_tool"`, `"incorrect_parameter_names"`, or `"incorrect_parameter_values"`
- `reason`: Detailed explanation list

### Example Usage

**Input:**
```json
{
  "available_tools": [
    {
      "name": "google-play-developer",
      "description": "Get apps by a developer on Google Play",
      "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "devId": {"type": "string", "description": "Developer ID"},
          "num": {"type": "number", "default": 60, "description": "Number of results"},
          "lang": {"type": "string", "default": "en", "description": "Language code"},
          "country": {"type": "string", "default": "us", "description": "Country code"}
        },
        "required": ["devId"]
      }
    }
  ],
  "message_history": [
    {
      "role": "user", 
      "content": "Get apps by developer 'com.example.dev' with 50 results in English for US market"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I'll fetch the apps for that developer.",
      "tool_calls": [
        {
          "function": {
            "name": "google-play-developer",
            "arguments": {
              "devId": "com.example.dev",
              "num": 50,
              "lang": "en",
              "country": "us"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "score": "correct",
  "reason": []
}
```

### Underlying Model

The evaluation is powered by the [Limbic Tool Use Evaluator](https://huggingface.co/quotientai/limbic-tool-use-0.5B-32K), a fine-tuned Qwen 2.5 0.5B model specifically designed for MCP function call evaluation.

## Integration Examples

### Cursor IDE

You can use the Quotient MCP server in Cursor IDE by adding the following to your `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quotient-mcp-server": {
      "url": "https://mcp.quotientai.co"
    }
  }
}
```

Then, add an evaluation rule in `.cursor/rules/evaluate-tool-call.mdc` to always apply the `evaluate_tool_call` function after any agent tool call.

```markdown
---
alwaysApply: true
---
# Evaluate Tool Calls Rule

## Critical Rule

- Always use the `evaluate_tool_call` function after any agent tool call to evaluate proper usage of the tool
- Use this function to validate that tools are being called correctly with proper parameters
- Apply this evaluation when assessing agent performance or troubleshooting tool usage issues

## When to Apply

- After Any Tool Call
- When reviewing agent conversations that involve tool calls
- When validating that an AI agent correctly used available tools
- When checking if tool parameters were set correctly
- When assessing overall agent tool calling performance

## Example Usage

<example>
When evaluating if an agent correctly used tools, always call:
evaluate_tool_call(available_tools, message_history)

This ensures proper validation of tool usage patterns and parameter correctness.
</example>
```

### Claude Code

You can use the Quotient MCP server in Claude Code by adding the following to your project:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http https://mcp.quotientai.co/mcp/
```

Then, add to your project instructions to always use the `evaluate_tool_call` function after any agent tool call.

```markdown
# Project Instructions

## Tool Usage Requirements

- Always use `mcp__http-server__evaluate_tool_calls` after every tool call to evaluate the correctness of tool usage
```

### OpenAI Agents SDK

You can use the Quotient MCP server in various agent SDKs such as the OpenAI Agents SDK by adding the following to your agent configuration:

```python
from agents.mcp import MCPServerStreamableHttp

# custom prompt prefix for tool use evaluation
TOOL_USE_EVAL_PROMPT_PREFIX = """
After using any tool, you should use the tool_use_evaluator from quotient_mcp to evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of the tool usage.
"""

# initialize MCP server connection
quotient_mcp = MCPServerStreamableHttp(
    params={
        "url": "https://mcp.quotientai.co/mcp/",
    },
    name="Quotient MCP Server",
)

# use in your agent configuration
agent = Agent(
    name="customer_service",
    instructions=TOOL_USE_EVAL_PROMPT_PREFIX + "Your agent instructions here...",
    mcp_servers=[quotient_mcp]
)
```

## Open Source

Quotient MCP is open sourced at [https://github.com/quotient-ai/quotient-mcp](https://github.com/quotient-ai/quotient-mcp). 

# Transports 

As of 2025-07-30, we currently support the Streamable HTTP transport. We're actively working on supporting stdio.
