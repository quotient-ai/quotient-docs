# Logger Initialization

Initialize the Quotient logger with configuration settings for your application:

```python
from quotientai import QuotientAI

quotient = QuotientAI(api_key="your-quotient-api-key")

logger = quotient.logger.init(
    app_name: str,
    environment: str,
    tags: dict = None,
    sample_rate: float = 1.0,
    hallucination_detection: bool = False,
    hallucination_detection_sample_rate: float = 0.0,
    inconsistency_detection: bool = False,
)
```

**Parameters:**

- `user_query` (str, required)
    - The input query or prompt sent to the model
    - Used for analyzing input patterns and correlating with model behavior
- `model_output` (str, required)
    - The response generated by the model
    - Used for quality assessment and performance analysis
- `documents` (List[Union[str, dict]], optional)
    - List of document contents used as context for the model
    - Helps in grounding and attribution analysis
    - If a dictionary is passed, it must have the key `page_content` , containing the document text, and optionally `metadata`, containing any document metadata you want to capture about the document.
    - **Example:**
    
    ```
    [
        "Sample Document 1 without metadata",
        {"page_content": "Sample Document 2 with metadata", "metadata": {"source": "google.com"},
        {"page_content": "Sample Document 3 without metadata"}
    ]
    ```
    
- `message_history` (List[dict], optional)
    - Previous messages in the conversation
    - List of dictionaries matching the OpenAI message format â€” contains keys `"role"` and `"content"`
    - Helps in grounding and attribution analysis where messages in message history may contain context used in model ouput
    - **Example:**
        ```
        [
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert on geography."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": "The capital of France is Paris"}
        ]
        ```
        
- `instructions` (List[str], optional)
    - List of instructions provided to the model
    - Used for analyzing impact of different prompting strategies
    - **Example:**
        
        ```
        [
            "You are a helpful assistant that answers questions about the world.",
            "Answer the question in a concise manner. If you are not sure, say 'I don't know'."
        ]
        
        ```
        
- `tags` (dict, optional)
    - Override or extend the tags specified during initialization
    - Takes precedence over initialization tags for the same keys
    - **Example:** `{"model": "gpt-4-mini", "feature": "customer-support"}`

**Return Value:**

The `.log()` method returns `uuid` representing the log_id.

# Retrieving Logs

Synchronously retrieve logs sent to Quotient using the client.

```python
logs = quotient.logs.list()
# [Log(id='', app_name='', environment='', created_at=''), ...]
```

Asynchronously retrieve logs sent to Quotient using client.

```python
logs = await quotient.logs.list()
# [Log(id='', app_name='', environment='', created_at=''), ...]
```





# Async Logging

An asynchronous version of the log method is available for use in async contexts:

```python
log_id = await logger.log(
    user_query: str,
    model_output: str,
    documents: List[str] = None,
    message_history: Optional[List[dict]] = None,
    instructions: Optional[List[str]] = None,
    tags: dict = None
)
```
