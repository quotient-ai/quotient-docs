Quotient provides intelligent observability for AI apps by automatically detecting problems, identifying root causes, and providing visibility -- see what's broken, where it happens, and why.

## ðŸ§  Why Quotient AI?

Quotient Detections enables you to automatically catch hallucinations and other reliability issues in your AI outputs as you log responses. You can:

- Track and measure the reliability of your LLM-powered applications
- Identify which retrieved documents contributed to generated responses
- Calculate hallucination rates across different environments
- Flag responses that cannot be traced back to source documents

all with the Quotient SDK in Python or TypeScript.

## How does it work?

### Seamless Integration

With just a few lines of code, our lightweight SDK connects to your application and streams structured logs.
