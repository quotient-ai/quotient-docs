title: 'Prompts'
---

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing inputs to guide large language models (LLMs) to produce desired responses. Each prompt has two key components: a system prompt and a user prompt -- both integrated within a single `Prompt` object for management and retrieval.

- **System Prompt:** Provides background context or instructions to influence the modelâ€™s overall behavior.
- **User Prompt:** The specific question or input meant for the model to address in its response.

Using the Quotient SDK, you can manage `Prompt`s by creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting them programmatically within your application.

## Creating Prompts

To create a new prompt, use the `create()` method, specifying a unique name, a system prompt for model behavior, and a user prompt for user interaction.

\```python
from quotientai import QuotientAI

# Initialize the QuotientAI SDK client
quotient = QuotientAI()

# Create a new prompt with a system message and user message
new_prompt = quotient.prompts.create(
    name="Customer Support Inquiry",
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant.",
    user_prompt="How can I assist you today?"
)

# Print the created prompt object to verify its details
print(new_prompt)
\```

<Note>Prompt names must be unique within your Quotient account. Attempting to create a prompt with an existing name will raise an error.</Note>

---

## Retrieving a Specific Prompt

To retrieve a prompt by its ID (and optionally by version), use the `get()` method.

\```python
prompt_id = quotient.prompts.list()[0].id
prompt = quotient.prompts.get(prompt_id)

print(prompt)
\```

<Tip>
The returned `Prompt` object includes a `messages` property, useful for integration with model provider libraries (e.g., OpenAI).

\```python
from openai import OpenAI
from quotientai import QuotientAI

oai = OpenAI()
quotient = QuotientAI()

prompt = quotient.prompts.get(prompt_id)

response = oai.chat.completions.create(
    messages=prompt.messages,
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
)
\```
</Tip>

## Listing Prompts

Retrieve all available prompts using the `list()` method. Each prompt includes details like `id`, `name`, `system_prompt`, and `user_prompt`.

\```python
prompts = quotient.prompts.list()

for prompt in prompts:
    print(prompt)
\```

## Versioning Prompts

Each prompt starts at version 0 upon creation. Quotient manages prompt versions, linking them by prompt name and unique ID.

### Creating a New Prompt Version

To update a promptâ€™s details, use the `update()` method. If any attributes (like `name`, `system_prompt`, or `user_prompt`) change, the version is automatically incremented.

\```python
# Update the user message of an existing prompt
updated_prompt = quotient.prompts.update(
    prompt=prompt,
    user_prompt="Appropriately answer customer questions: {{input}}."
)

# Print the updated prompt details
print(updated_prompt)
\```

You can also simply run:

\```python
updated_user_prompt = "Appropriately answer customer questions: {{input}}. Be concise in your answers."
prompt.user_prompt = updated_user_prompt
\```

## Deleting a Prompt

Deleting a prompt removes all its associated versions. Use the `delete()` method with the `Prompt` object you wish to remove.

\```python
quotient.prompts.delete(prompt)

# Confirm the deletion
print("Prompt deleted successfully!")
\```
