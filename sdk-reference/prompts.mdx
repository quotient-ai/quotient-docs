Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining inputs for large language models (LLMs) to guide them toward producing the desired output. A well-crafted prompt can shape the response's tone, structure, and content. In the context of QuotientAI, prompt engineering is central to creating and managing precise interactions with LLMs to solve specific problems or answer questions effectively.

At its core, prompt engineering involves:

- **System Prompts**: Providing instructions or context that guides the modelâ€™s behavior.
- **User Prompts**: Defining the specific question or input from the user that the model will address.

By using QuotientAIâ€™s SDK, you can interact with prompts directly in your application, enabling the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of prompts programmatically.

## Creating Prompts

The Quotient Python SDK allows you to manage and interact with prompts through a simple interface.

To create a new prompt, use the `create()` method. This method allows you to specify a name, a system prompt for general model guidance, and a user prompt as the primary input.

```python
from quotientai import QuotientAI

# Initialize the QuotientAI SDK client
quotient = QuotientAI()

# Create a new prompt with a system message and user message
new_prompt = quotient.prompts.create(
    name="Customer Support Inquiry",
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant.",
    user_prompt="How can I assist you today?"
)

# Print the created prompt object to verify its details
print(new_prompt)
```

<Note>The returned `Prompt` object also has a `messages` property that you can use as input to model provider libraries like OpenAI.</Note>

## Listing Prompts

To list all available prompts, use the `list()` method. Each prompt contains details like `id`, `name`, `system_prompt`, and `user_prompt`.

```python
from quotientai import QuotientAI

# Initialize the QuotientAI SDK client
quotient = QuotientAI()

# Retrieve a list of all prompts
prompts = quotient.prompts.list()

# Iterate through the list and print each prompt
for prompt in prompts:
    print(prompt)
```

## Retrieving a Specific Prompt

If you need to retrieve details of a specific prompt by its ID (and optional version), use the `get()` method.

```python
# Retrieve the ID of the first prompt in the list for demonstration
prompt_id = quotient.prompts.list()[0].id
# This can be any prompt ID e.g., 
prompt_id = "prompt-id"

# Get the prompt by its ID
prompt = quotient.prompts.get(prompt_id)

# Print the prompt details
print(prompt)
```

This will return the prompt with the specified ID and its associated messages, which you can use to send to an LLM.

## Updating an Existing Prompt

You can update a prompt's name, system prompt, or user prompt with the `update()` method. Hereâ€™s an example of updating a promptâ€™s user message:

```python
# Update the user message of an existing prompt
updated_prompt = quotient.prompts.update(
    prompt=prompt,
    user_prompt="Appropriately answer customer questions: {{input}}."
)

# Print the updated prompt details
print(updated_prompt)
```

You can also simply run:

```python
updated_user_prompt = "Appropriately answer customer questions: {{input}}. Be concise in your answers."
prompt.user_prompt = updated_user_prompt
```

## Deleting a Prompt

To delete a prompt, call the `delete()` method. Ensure that you pass the `Prompt` object you intend to delete.

```python
# Delete the specified prompt
quotient.prompts.delete(prompt)

# Confirm the deletion
print("Prompt deleted successfully!")
```
