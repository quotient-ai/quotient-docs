title: 'Prompts'
---

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing inputs to guide large language models (LLMs) to produce desired responses. Each prompt has two key components: a system prompt and a user prompt -- both integrated within a single `Prompt` object for management and retrieval.

- **System Prompt:** Provides background context or instructions to influence the model’s overall behavior.
- **User Prompt:** The specific question or input meant for the model to address in its response.

Using the Quotient SDK, you can manage `Prompt`s by creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting them programmatically within your application.

## Prompt Templating
Prompts can use `{{input}}` and `{{context}}` as templating variables to dynamically pass values during prompt execution. This allows for flexibility in testing different inputs.

## Creating Prompts

To create a new prompt, use the `create()` method, specifying a unique name, a system prompt for model behavior, and a user prompt for user interaction.

```typescript
import { QuotientAI } from 'quotientai';

const quotient = new QuotientAI();

const new_prompt = await quotient.prompts.create({
    name: "Customer Support Inquiry",
    system_prompt: "You are a helpful assistant.",
    user_prompt: "How can I assist you today?"
});

console.log(new_prompt);
```

<Note> Prompt names must be unique within your Quotient account. Attempting to create a prompt with an existing name will raise an error.</Note>

## Retrieving a Specific Prompt

To retrieve a prompt by its ID (and optionally by version), use the `get()` method.

```typescript
const prompt_id = (await quotient.prompts.list())[0].id;
const prompt = await quotient.prompts.get(prompt_id);

console.log(prompt);
```

<Tip>
The returned `Prompt` object includes a `messages` property, useful for integration with model provider libraries (e.g., OpenAI)
  
```typescript
import { OpenAI } from 'openai';
import { QuotientAI } from 'quotientai';

const oai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env['OPENAI_API_KEY'] });
const quotient = new QuotientAI();

const prompt = await quotient.prompts.get(prompt_id);

const response = await oai.chat.completions.create({
    messages: prompt.messages,
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
});

console.log(response);
```
</Tip>

## Listing Prompts

Retrieve all available prompts using the `list()` method. Each prompt includes details like `id`, `name`, `system_prompt`, and `user_prompt`.

```typescript
    const prompts = await quotient.prompts.list();

for (const prompt of prompts) {
    console.log(prompt);
}
```

## Versioning Prompts

Each prompt starts at version 0 upon creation. Quotient manages prompt versions, linking them by prompt name and unique ID.

### Creating a New Prompt Version

To update a prompt’s details and have them recorded in Quotient, use the `update()` method. If any attributes (like `name`, `system_prompt`, or `user_prompt`) change, the version is automatically incremented.

```typescript
prompt.user_prompt = "How can I assist you today? Please provide more details.";

const updated_prompt = await quotient.prompts.update(prompt);

console.log(updated_prompt);
```


## Deleting a Prompt

Deleting a prompt removes all its associated versions. Use the `delete()` method with the `Prompt` object you wish to remove.

```typescript
await quotient.prompts.delete(prompt);

console.log("Prompt deleted successfully!");
```

<Note> Prompts are soft-deleted -- if you'd like to permanently remove prompts, contact us at [support@quotientai.co](mailto:support@quotientai.co)</Note>
