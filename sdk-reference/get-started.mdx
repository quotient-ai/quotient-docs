  <Step title="Create a Script">
    Create a file named `prompting.py` with the following code:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```python prompting.py
      from quotientai import QuotientAI

      quotient = QuotientAI()

      prompt = quotient.prompts.create(
        name="my-first-prompt",
        system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant.",
        user_prompt="Your task is to assist customers by providing clear, concise, and helpful responses to their inquiries."
      )
      
      print(prompt)
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the Script">
    Using your API key, run the script to create your first prompt:
    ```console
    QUOTIENT_API_KEY=your-api-key python prompting.py
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open in PromptLab">
    You just created your first prompt! Now can go to the Quotient Web UI and open your prompt [PromptLab](https://app.quotientai.co/prompts).

    Hit `Run` and see what happens!
