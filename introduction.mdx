# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Quotient AI

Quotient is an advanced AI development and evaluation platform. We combine our experience building evals for top AI products with state-of-the-art research to make it simple and fast to prototype, evaluate, and ship AI products without the unnecessary technical overhead.

## ðŸ§  Why Quotient AI?

We take care of the unnecessary complexity out of AI development and evaluation, so developers can focus on what's exciting. Quotient's platform provides multiple tools that work together to achieve that goal:

**PromptLab** is a prompt engineering environment for experimentation and refinement. Developers can version prompts, test across different models, and bootstrap evaluation datasets from their examples - turning test cases into comprehensive eval suites.

**IQ** is an AI development copilot for writing, analyzing, and improving prompts through interactive sessions. It works like pair programming with an AI expert who knows LLM best practices.

The **Quotient SDK** is a straightforward Python package that gives teams access to Quotient's full evaluation infrastructure. It enables thorough testing of models, prompts, configurations, and RAG systems before release. Developers can:

- Run comprehensive eval suites with auto-generated evaluation code
- Choose from ready-to-use evaluation metrics
- Track prompt and dataset versions, and seamlessly incorporate prompts into their codebase
