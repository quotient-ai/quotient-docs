Quotient is an intelligent monitoring platform for retrieval-augmented and search-augmented AI applications and agents. 

Our system, Limbic, captures and processes agent behavior, helps you understand it, and automatically improves your agents for you.

## ðŸ§  Why Quotient AI?

Quotient enables you to automatically detect and improve reliability issues in your AI applications and agents.

- Track and measure the reliability of your LLM-powered applications and agents
- Identify which retrieved context contributes to generated responses
- Calculate hallucination rates across different environments and models
- Flag responses that cannot be traced back to source context
- Automatically fix hallucinations and other reliability issues

all with the Quotient SDK in Python or TypeScript in a few lines of code.

## ðŸ§¬ How does it work?

We provide an SDK that enables you to send us logs & traces, and we use that data to automatically produce reports (overall usage and reliability metrics) and detections (e.g. hallucinations, context attribution, context usage, tool usage) to keep you in the loop so you know how people are using your applications and agents.

We also provide an [MCP server](/steering/quotient-mcp) that can be used to steer agent behavior in real-time and in production using our own models. 

Our first model, [`limbic-tool-use-0.5B-32K`](https://huggingface.co/quotientai/limbic-tool-use-0.5B-32K) is trained to assess inaccuracies with tool use in AI agents.

We're continuing to develop Limbic to automatically steer your agents for you given your instructions and historical context captured through logs and traces.
