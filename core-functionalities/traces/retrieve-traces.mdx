Use the SDK to fetch trace details for automation, regression analysis, or exporting into external systems. Currently the API retrieves individual traces by ID.

## Fetch a Trace

```python get_trace.py
from quotientai import QuotientAI

quotient = QuotientAI()

trace = quotient.traces.get(trace_id="123")
print(trace)
```

### Notes

* The response includes the trace metadata and spans captured during the interaction.
* Combine with webhooks or your own telemetry to store trace IDs for later retrieval.
* Watch the Quotient changelog for bulk trace export support.
