You can enrich traces with custom spans to document important steps that are unique to your application. Use `quotient.tracing.start_span` as a context manager or access the active span via OpenTelemetry utilities.

## Create a Manual Span

```python custom_span.py
from opentelemetry.trace import get_current_span

from quotientai import QuotientAI
from quotientai.tracing import start_span

quotient = QuotientAI()

quotient.tracer.init(
    app_name="my-app",
    environment="dev",
)

@quotient.trace('support-agent')
def main() -> None:
    with start_span('reranker'):
        span = get_current_span()
        span.set_attribute('reranker.latency_ms', 105)
        span.set_attribute('reranker.model', 'cross-encoder-large')

        # run your custom logic here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Best Practices

* Give spans descriptive names that identify the step or component (e.g., `reranker`, `sql-query`).
* Set attributes for metrics, inputs, or decisions you care aboutâ€”anything that helps debug later.
* Keep spans narrow in scope so they clearly mark a single unit of work.
