After initialization you can start capturing traces. Quotient provides two primary approaches:

1. **`@quotient.trace` decorator** – wrap your entrypoint or key functions to record spans.
2. **OpenInference instrumentors** – automatically instrument supported frameworks and providers.

## Decorate an Entrypoint

```python traced_agent.py
from quotientai import QuotientAI

quotient = QuotientAI()

@quotient.trace('support-agent')
def run_agent(question: str) -> str:
    """Main entrypoint for your agent."""
    # call tools, models, etc.
    return "Answer goes here"

run_agent("How do I reset my password?")
```

The decorator creates a root span for the function and tracks child spans for tool calls when instrumentation is available.

## Use OpenInference Instrumentation

Quotient integrates with [OpenInference](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference) so you can reuse the same telemetry across frameworks. Attach the appropriate instrumentor when initializing the tracer:

```python with_instrumentor.py
from openinference.instrumentation.langchain import LangChainInstrumentor
from quotientai import QuotientAI

quotient = QuotientAI()

quotient.tracer.init(
    app_name="langgraph-weather-app",
    environment="dev",
    instruments=[LangChainInstrumentor()],
)
```

Instrumentors add spans for prompts, tool invocations, retriever calls, and more—no code changes required in the rest of your app.

### Supported Frameworks

We provide step-by-step guides for popular agent frameworks:

* [Agno](../../integrations/agent-frameworks/agno)
* [OpenAI Agents SDK](../../integrations/agent-frameworks/openai-agents-sdk)
* [LangGraph](../../integrations/agent-frameworks/langgraph)
* [Smolagents](../../integrations/agent-frameworks/smolagents)

Looking for another framework? See [OpenInference instrumentation](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference/tree/main/python/instrumentation) for additional options.

## Tracing Without OpenInference

You can still use the decorator without OpenInference instrumentors. You will capture the function-level span and any custom spans you emit manually. Note that certain Quotient features (detections, tooling insights) rely on the richer span data provided by instrumentors.
