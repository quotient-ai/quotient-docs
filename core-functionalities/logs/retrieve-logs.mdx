Use the SDKs to programmatically retrieve logs for debugging, evaluation, or custom analytics pipelines.

## List Logs

<CodeGroup>

```python list_logs.py
# Assumes quotient client is already initialized (see Initialize the Logger)
logs = quotient.logs.list()
print("Total logs:", len(logs))
for log in logs:
    print(log["id"], log.get("user_query"))
```

```typescript listLogs.ts
// Assumes quotient client is already initialized (see Initialize the Logger)
const logs = await quotient.logs.list();
console.log("Total logs:", logs.length);
logs.forEach(log => {
  console.log(log.id, log.userQuery);
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Common Fields

Each returned `Log` object may contain:

* `id` *(string)*: Unique identifier for the log.
* `app_name` *(string)*: Application that generated the interaction.
* `environment` *(string)*: Deployment environment (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`).
* `user_query` *(string)*: The prompt that initiated the interaction.
* `model_output` *(string)*: Response recorded for the interaction.
* `documents` *(array)*: Evidence passed in with the log.
* `message_history` *(array)*: Conversation turns, if provided.
* `instructions` *(array)*: Instruction set supplied to the model.
* `tags` *(object)*: Metadata such as feature, customer, or model version.
* `created_at` / `updated_at` *(datetime)*: Timestamps for auditability.
* `has_hallucination` *(boolean)*: Whether hallucination detection flagged the response.
* `evaluations` *(array)*: Detailed detection results.

## Usage Tips

* Narrow queries with filters (if available) to keep responses manageable.
* Paginate long-running exports rather than loading the entire history at once.
* Persist the returned `log_id` in your own telemetry to cross-reference issues in the Quotient UI.
