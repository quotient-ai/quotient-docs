You can retrieve logs programmatically to inspect what has been recorded. This is useful for debugging, offline analysis, or integrating Quotient logs into your own monitoring systems.

## Example

<CodeGroup>

```python list_logs.py
logs = quotient.logs.list()
print("Total logs:", len(logs))
for log in logs:
    print(log["id"], log["user_query"])
```

```typescript list_logs.ts
const logs = await quotient.logs.list();
console.log("Total logs:", logs.length);
logs.forEach(log => {
  console.log(log.id, log.userQuery);
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Returned Fields

Each log object may contain:

* **`id`** *(string)*: Unique identifier for the log.
* **`app_name`** *(string)*: Application that created the log.
* **`environment`** *(string)*: Environment of origin (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`).
* **`user_query`** *(string)*: The query that was logged.
* **`model_output`** *(string)*: The modelâ€™s response.
* **`documents`** *(array)*: Documents used as evidence.
* **`message_history`** *(array)*: Conversation turns.
* **`instructions`** *(array)*: Instruction list provided.
* **`tags`** *(object)*: Metadata tags.
* **`created_at`** *(datetime)*: Timestamp of log creation.
* **`updated_at`** *(datetime)*: Timestamp of last update.
* **`has_hallucination`** *(boolean)*: Whether a hallucination was detected.
* **`evaluations`** *(array)*: Results of applied detections.

## Best Practices

* Use filters (when available) to limit log retrieval by environment, tag, or time range.
* Avoid fetching entire log history into memory; paginate when analyzing large volumes.
* Store `log_id` in your own systems for traceability back to the Quotient dashboard.
