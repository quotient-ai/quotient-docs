title: 'Sending Logs'
description: 'Log interactions with queries, model outputs, and supporting context.'
icon: "bolt"

Once the logger is initialized, you can start sending logs to Quotient. Each log represents a **single interaction** between a user and your model. Include the query, the modelâ€™s output, and the evidence you relied on (documents, history, or instructions).

Providing evidence is critical when using hallucination or document relevance detection. At least one of `documents`, `message_history`, or `instructions` is required.

## Example

<CodeGroup>

```python logging.py
log_id = quotient.log(
    user_query="How do I cook a goose?",
    model_output="The capital of France is Paris",
    documents=[
        "Sample Document 1 without metadata",
        {"page_content": "Sample Document 2 with metadata", "metadata": {"source": "google.com"}},
        {"page_content": "Sample Document 3 without metadata"}
    ],
    message_history=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert on cooking."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "How do I cook a goose?"}
    ],
    instructions=[
        "Answer concisely.",
        "If you are not sure, say 'I don't know'."
    ],
    tags={"model": "gpt-4", "feature": "recipes"}
)

print("Log created with ID:", log_id)
```

```typescript logging.ts
const logId = await quotient.log({
  userQuery: "How do I cook a goose?",
  modelOutput: "The capital of France is Paris",
  documents: [
    "Sample Document 1 without metadata",
    { pageContent: "Sample Document 2 with metadata", metadata: { source: "google.com" } },
    { pageContent: "Sample Document 3 without metadata" }
  ],
  messageHistory: [
    { role: "system", content: "You are an expert on cooking." },
    { role: "user", content: "How do I cook a goose?" }
  ],
  instructions: [
    "Answer concisely.",
    "If you are not sure, say 'I don't know'."
  ],
  tags: { model: "gpt-4", feature: "recipes" }
});

console.log("Log created with ID:", logId);
```

</CodeGroup>

## Parameters

* **`user_query`** *(string)*: Input query or prompt. Required when hallucination or document relevancy detection is enabled.
* **`model_output`** *(string)*: The response generated by the model. Required when hallucination detection is enabled.
* **`documents`** *(array\<string|object>)*: Evidence documents. If objects are provided, they must have a `page_content` key and may include `metadata`. Example:

  ```json
  [
    "Plain string document",
    { "page_content": "Document with metadata", "metadata": { "source": "kb.pdf" } }
  ]
  ```
* **`message_history`** *(array)*: Previous messages following OpenAI format `{ role, content }`. Required if used for hallucination detection.
* **`instructions`** *(array)*: Instruction strings given to the model. Used in hallucination detection.
* **`tags`** *(object)*: Custom metadata to attach to the log. Example: `{ "model": "gpt-4", "customer": "enterprise-A" }`.

## Notes

* When hallucination detection is enabled, **one of `documents`, `message_history`, or `instructions` is required**.
* Log only the documents actually retrieved, not the entire corpus.
* Metadata tags make reports far more useful (e.g., breakdown by retriever or model version).

## Best Practices

* Keep evidence minimal but sufficient for attribution (avoid dumping full corpora).
* Standardize tag keys (`model`, `retriever`, `customer`) for consistent filtering.
* Include the returned `log_id` in your own telemetry to cross-reference with Quotient reports.
