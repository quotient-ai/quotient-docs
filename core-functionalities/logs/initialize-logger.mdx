title: 'Initialize the Logger'
description: 'Configure the Quotient logger once to describe your app, environment, and detections.'
icon: "code"
---

Before sending any records you must initialize the logger. Initialization tells Quotient **which app generated the data**, **which environment it came from**, and **which detections to run**.

## Basic Initialization

<CodeGroup>

```python logging.py
from quotientai import QuotientAI, DetectionType

quotient = QuotientAI(api_key="your-quotient-api-key")

quotient.logger.init(
    app_name="my-first-app",
    environment="dev",
    detections=[DetectionType.HALLUCINATION, DetectionType.DOCUMENT_RELEVANCY],
    detection_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```

```typescript logging.ts
import { QuotientAI, DetectionType } from "quotientai";

const quotient = new QuotientAI({ apiKey: "your-quotient-api-key" });

quotient.logger.init({
  appName: "my-first-app",
  environment: "dev",
  detections: [DetectionType.HALLUCINATION, DetectionType.DOCUMENT_RELEVANCY],
  detectionSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

</CodeGroup>

### Key Parameters

* `app_name` *(string)*: Logical application name. Used as the primary grouping dimension in the dashboard.
* `environment` *(string)*: Where the app is running (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`, etc.). Drives environment filters.
* `tags` *(object, optional)*: Default metadata applied to every log (e.g., `{ "team": "growth" }`).
* `sample_rate` *(float)*: Percentage of logs to persist. `1.0` captures everything, lower values sample.
* `detections` *(array)*: Which automated checks to run, such as `HALLUCINATION` or `DOCUMENT_RELEVANCY`.
* `detection_sample_rate` *(float)*: Sampling rate for detections specifically. Defaults to `0.0` (disabled).

### Tips

* Call `logger.init` once during application startup; repeated calls reuse the same configuration.
* Use configuration files or environment variables to keep app name and environment consistent across deploys.
* Provide `tags` for metadata you want on *every* log (e.g., team, product surface).
