Logs are the most fundamental unit in Quotient. Logs are a way to capture specific data points from your AI applications and agents.
A log represents a single interaction between your system and a model: it captures the user query, the modelâ€™s output, and any supporting context such as retrieved documents. All detections and reports are built on top of logs.

Logs differ from traces:
- Logs: focused in specific events or actions, useful for measuring outputs and checking reliability.
- Traces: multi-step workflows that capture the full path of execution.

## Structure of a Log

Logs on Quotient follow a simple schema:

```bash
{
    "user_query": "What is the capital of France?",
    "model_output": "The capital of France is Paris",
    "documents": ["Here is an excellent goose recipe..."]
}
```

It typically contains:

* `user_query`: the input from the user or upstream system.
* `model_output`: the raw output from the model.
* `documents`: the retrieved documents or evidence used.
* `metadata`: optional fields like environment, app name, or custom tags.

## When to Use Logs

* **Development**: log every interaction for full visibility.
* **Production**: sample interactions to balance cost and coverage.
* **Evaluation**: log curated test sets to benchmark models or retrievers.

## Example

<CodeGroup>

```python logging.py
from quotientai import QuotientAI, DetectionType

quotient = QuotientAI()
quotient.logger.init(
    app_name="support-bot",
    environment="dev",
    detections=[DetectionType.HALLUCINATION, DetectionType.DOCUMENT_RELEVANCY],
    detection_sample_rate=1.0
)

log = quotient.log(
    user_query="What is the warranty policy?",
    model_output="All items have a 5-year warranty.",
    documents=["Policy: electronics have a 1-year warranty..."]
)

print(log["detections"])
# {"hallucination": True, "document_relevancy": 0.0}
```

```typescript logging.ts
import { QuotientAI, DetectionType } from "@quotientai";

const quotient = new QuotientAI();
quotient.logger.init({
  appName: "support-bot",
  environment: "dev",
  detections: [DetectionType.HALLUCINATION, DetectionType.DOCUMENT_RELEVANCY],
  detectionSampleRate: 1.0
});

const log = await q.log({
  userQuery: "What is the warranty policy?",
  modelOutput: "All items have a 5-year warranty.",
  documents: ["Policy: electronics have a 1-year warranty..."]
});

console.log(log.detections);
// { hallucination: true, document_relevancy: 0.0 }
```

## Best Practices

* Keep `detection_sample_rate=1.0` in development for maximum coverage. Tune it down in production if needed.
* Use distinct `environment` values (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`) so reports remain clean and comparable.
* Avoid logging raw PII. Redact or anonymize sensitive fields before sending logs.
* Add metadata fields (e.g. model version, feature flag, or customer segment) to make debugging easier in reports.
* Rotate API keys per environment for better security.
