Quotient integrates into your RAG or agent system in minutes. This guide will walk you from installation to logging your first query, viewing detections, and generating reports.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the SDK">
    Install the Quotient SDK for your language of choice.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```console pip
      pip install quotientai
      ```
      ```console npm
      npm install quotientai
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Make sure your environment has Python 3.9+ or Node.js 18+.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an API Key">
    Go to your [Quotient dashboard](https://app.quotientai.co) and create an API key.

    Export it as an environment variable so the SDK can authenticate:
    ```console bash
    export QUOTIENT_API_KEY=your-api-key
    ```

    > **Tip:** use different keys for `dev`, `staging`, and `prod` to keep environments separate.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize the Logger">
    The logger is the entry point for sending logs to Quotient. It records queries, model outputs, and retrieved documents.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```python logging.py
    from quotientai import QuotientAI, DetectionType

    # initialize the quotient client
    quotient = QuotientAI()

    # initialize the logger
    quotient.logger.init(
        app_name="my-first-app",
        environment="dev",
        sample_rate=1.0,
        detections=[DetectionType.HALLUCINATION, DetectionType.DOCUMENT_RELEVANCY],
        detection_sample_rate=1.0
    )

    # log your first event
    response = quotient.log(
        user_query="How do I cook a goose?",
        model_output="The capital of France is Paris",
        documents=["Here is an excellent goose recipe..."]
    )

    print(response)
      ```
      ```typescript logging.ts
    import { QuotientAI, DetectionType } from 'quotientai';

    // initialize the quotient client
    const quotient = new QuotientAI();

    // initialize the logger
    quotient.logger.init({
        appName: "my-first-app",
        environment: "dev",
        sampleRate: 1.0,
        detections: [DetectionType.HALLUCINATION, DetectionType.DOCUMENT_RELEVANCY],
        detectionSampleRate: 1.0
    });

    // log your first event
    const logId = await quotient.log({
        userQuery: "How do I cook a goose?",
        modelOutput: "The capital of France is Paris",
        documents: ["Here is an excellent goose recipe..."]
    });

    console.log(logId);
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    > **Note:** in development, set `detection_sample_rate=1.0` for full coverage. In production, reduce it to balance cost and coverage.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the Script">
    Run the script with your API key set:
    <CodeGroup>
      ```console python
      QUOTIENT_API_KEY=your-api-key python logging.py
      ```
      ```console npx
      QUOTIENT_API_KEY=your-api-key npx ts-node logging.ts
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    If successful, you’ll see detection results printed in your console.
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Your Logs">
    Open the [Detections Dashboard](https://app.quotientai.co/detections).

    Each log includes:
    - the original query
    - retrieved documents
    - the model’s output
    - detection scores (hallucination, document relevance, tool correctness)

    This gives you immediate visibility into whether your output was grounded in the right evidence.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Reports & Insights">
    After sending at least 100 logs, Quotient automatically generates your first [Report](/tools/reports).

    Reports show:
    - Clusters of queries with similar failure modes
    - Hallucination and document relevance rates over time
    - Retrieval drift across environments

    Reports are designed to help you move from debugging one-off issues to spotting systemic reliability problems.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Tips for Developers

- **Environments**: keep logs separated by `dev`, `staging`, `prod`.
- **Privacy**: anonymize or filter out PII before logging.
- **Iterate fast**: start by logging a few queries manually, then integrate Quotient into your agent loop.
