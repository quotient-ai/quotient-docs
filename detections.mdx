You can use Quotient's SDK to automatically detect hallucinations and other reliability issues in your AI outputs.

# Initialize the Logger with Detections

<CodeGroup>
    ```python logging.py
    from quotientai import QuotientAI

    quotient = QuotientAI(api_key="your-quotient-api-key")

    logger = quotient.logger.init(
        app_name="my-first-app",
        environment="dev",
        sample_rate=1.0,
        # this will automatically run hallucination detection on 100% of your model outputs in relation to the documents you provide
        hallucination_detection=True,
        hallucination_detection_sample_rate=1.0,
    )
    ```

    ```typescript logging.ts
    import { QuotientAI } from "quotientai";

    const quotient = new QuotientAI({ apiKey: "your-quotient-api-key" });

    const logger = quotient.logger.init({
        appName: "my-first-app",
        environment: "dev",
        sampleRate: 1.0,
        // this will automatically run hallucination detection on 100% of your model outputs in relation to the documents you provide
        hallucinationDetection: true,
        hallucinationDetectionSampleRate: 1.0,
    });
    ```
</CodeGroup>

# Send Logs with Detections Enabled

<CodeGroup>
    ```python logging.py
    log_id = logger.log(
        user_query="What is the capital of France?",
        model_response="The path to greatness is through hard work and dedication.",
        documents=[
            "France is a country in Western Europe.",
            "Paris is the capital of France.",
        ],
    )
    ```
    ```typescript logging.ts
    const logId = await logger.log({
        userQuery: "What is the capital of France?",
        modelOutput: "The capital of France is Paris.",
        documents: ["France is a country in Western Europe.", "Paris is the capital of France."],
    });
    ```
</CodeGroup>

# Poll for Detections

Synchronously poll for detection results using the client:

<CodeGroup>
    ```python logging.py
    detection = logger.poll_for_detection(log_id=log_id)
    ```

    ```typescript logging.ts
    const detection = await logger.pollForDetection(logId);
    ```
</CodeGroup>

### Parameters:

<ParamField path="log_id" type="string" required>
    The log ID of the log you want to poll for detections.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="timeout" type="int" default="300">
    The maximum time to wait for a response in seconds.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="poll_interval" type="float" default="2.0">
    The interval between checks in seconds.
</ParamField>

### Returns:

<ResponseField name="detection" type="object" required>
    The detection results.
</ResponseField>

# Detections Dashboard

Go to the [Detections Dashboard](https://app.quotientai.co/detections) to see your logs and any detected hallucinations.
