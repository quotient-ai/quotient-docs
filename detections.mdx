You can use Quotient's SDK to automatically detect hallucinations and other reliability issues in your AI outputs.

# Initialize the Logger with Detections

<CodeGroup>
    ```python logging.py
    from quotientai import QuotientAI

    quotient = QuotientAI(api_key="your-quotient-api-key")

    logger = quotient.logger.init(
        app_name="my-first-app",
        environment="dev",
        sample_rate=1.0,
        # this will automatically run hallucination detection on 100% of your model outputs in relation to the documents you provide
        hallucination_detection=True,
        hallucination_detection_sample_rate=1.0,
    )
    ```

    ```typescript logging.ts
    import { QuotientAI } from "quotientai";

    const quotient = new QuotientAI({ apiKey: "your-quotient-api-key" });

    const logger = quotient.logger.init({
        app_name: "my-first-app",
        environment: "dev",
        sample_rate: 1.0,
        // this will automatically run hallucination detection on 100% of your model outputs in relation to the documents you provide
        hallucination_detection: true,
        hallucination_detection_sample_rate: 1.0,
    });
    ```
