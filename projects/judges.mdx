`judges` is a small library to use and create LLM-as-a-Judge evaluators. The purpose of judges is to have a curated set of LLM evaluators in a low-friction format across a variety of use cases that are backed by research, and can be used off-the-shelf or serve as inspiration for building your own LLM evaluators.
