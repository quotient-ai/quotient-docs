# What is document relevance?

**Document relevance** measures how well your retrieval or search system finds context that is genuinely useful for answering the user's query. A document is considered **relevant** if it contains information that addresses at least one part of the query. Otherwise, it is marked **irrelevant**.

The document relevance score is calculated as the fraction of documents that are relevant to the query.

# How Quotient scores relevance

1. Compare each document (or chunk) against the full `user_query`.
2. Determine whether the document contains information relevant to any part of the query:
   - If it does, mark it `relevant`.
   - If it does not, mark it `irrelevant`.
3. Compute `relevant_documents / total_documents` to derive the overall score.

## What influences the score

- **Chunk granularity:** smaller chunks make it easier to mark only the useful passages as relevant.
- **Query clarity:** ambiguous prompts can lower relevancy; capture clarifying follow-ups in `message_history`.
- **Retriever filters:** tag each log with retriever configuration so you can compare performance across setups.

## Why track document relevance?

Document relevance is a core metric for evaluating retrieval-augmented systems. Even if the AI generates well, weak retrieval can degrade the final answer. Monitoring this metric helps teams:

- Assess whether retrieval surfaces useful context.
- Debug cases where generation fails despite solid prompting.
- Improve recall and precision of retrievers.
- Watch for drift after retriever or data changes.

<Tip>
  A sudden dip in relevancy is often the earliest warning that embeddings, indexing, or filters changed. Alert on sustained drops before they cascade into hallucinations.

<Tip>
  High-performing systems typically show \> 75% document relevance. Lower scores may signal ambiguous user queries, incorrect retrieval, or noisy source data.
