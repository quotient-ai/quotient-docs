# Poll for detections via the SDK

Use the polling helpers when you want to block until detections finish so you can act on the results immediately (e.g., inside an evaluation harness or CI job).

<CodeGroup>

```python logging.py
detection = quotient.poll_for_detection(log_id=log_id)
```

```typescript logging.ts
const detection = await quotient.pollForDetections(logId);
```

</CodeGroup>

# Parameters

- `log_id` **(string)**: Identifier of the log you want to poll for detections.
- `timeout` **(int)**: Maximum time to wait for a response in seconds. Defaults to `300`.
- `poll_interval` **(float)**: Interval between checks in seconds. Defaults to `2.0`.

## Return value

`poll_for_detection` returns a `Log` object with these notable fields:

- `id` **(string)**: Unique identifier for the log.
- `app_name` **(string)**: Application that generated the log.
- `environment` **(string)**: Deployment environment (e.g., `dev`, `prod`).
- `detections` **(array)**: Detection types configured for this log.
- `detection_sample_rate` **(float)**: Sample rate applied for detections on this log.
- `user_query` **(string)**: Logged user input.
- `model_output` **(string)**: Logged model output.
- `documents` **(array)**: Context documents used for the detection run.
- `message_history` **(array)**: Prior messages following the OpenAI format.
- `instructions` **(array)**: Instructions provided to the model.
- `tags` **(object)**: Metadata associated with the log entry.
- `created_at` **(datetime)**: Timestamp when the log was created.
- `status` **(string)**: Current status of the log entry.
- `has_hallucination` **(boolean)**: Whether hallucinations were detected.
- `doc_relevancy_average` **(float)**: Average document relevancy score.
- `updated_at` **(datetime)**: Timestamp when the log was last updated.
- `evaluations` **(array)**: Evaluation results attached to the log.

## Example workflow

1. Log an interaction with detections enabled.
2. Call the polling helper and wait for the promise/function to resolve.
3. Inspect the returned `Log` payload for `has_hallucination` or `doc_relevancy_average` before deciding whether to alert, retry, or proceed.

<Tip>
  In long-running jobs, increase `timeout` or handle the timeout exception so you can fall back to asynchronous processing instead of failing the entire workflow.
