# How to Integrate Reports

Reports are automatically generated based on the logs and traces you send to Quotient. They become available once 100+ [detections](/tools/detections) have been generated within a 30-day window.

## Prerequisites

- **Consistent logging**: Send structured logs with `user_query`, `model_output`, and evidence so detections can run.
- **Detections enabled**: Hallucination and document relevance detections provide the quality signals that power report scoring.
- **Tag hygiene**: Attach tags such as `model`, `customer`, or `feature` to slice reports by meaningful segments.

## Data pipeline at a glance

1. Your application emits logs and traces through the Quotient SDKs.
2. Detections execute asynchronously on each record.
3. Reports aggregate detections and metadata into daily clusters with trend charts.
4. You review the dashboard (or export via API) to plan remediation.

## Best practices

- Keep `detection_sample_rate` high enough to capture statistically significant coverage for each segment you care about.
- Align tags with your roadmap—if you track `model_version` or `retriever`, you can measure the impact of each launch.
- Review reports alongside [Logs](/core-functionalities/logs/overview) and [Traces](/core-functionalities/traces/overview) to trace issues from cluster to underlying interaction.

<Tip>
  If your traffic is bursty, consider uploading a curated evaluation set to quickly hit the 100-detection threshold and unlock reports before production volume ramps.
