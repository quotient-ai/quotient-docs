# When to Use Reports

Reports are most valuable when you need to:

- **Perform content gap analysis**: Identify topics where your agent consistently struggles.
- **Optimize queries**: Find patterns in prompts that lead to poor results.
- **Prioritize roadmap work**: Focus improvements on high-volume or high-risk areas.
- **Monitor trends**: Track how system performance changes over time.

## Common scenarios

- **Post-launch monitoring:** watch how a new prompt, retriever, or model performs across your customer base.
- **Support triage:** surface clusters tied to specific accounts so customer-facing teams have context before reaching out.
- **Evaluation cycles:** run scripted tests, trigger detections, and let reports highlight regressions between builds.

## Signals to watch

- Rising hallucination rate for a specific model or feature flag.
- Clusters with rapidly increasing query volume but low relevancy scores.
- Repeated issues for a high-value customer or account tier.

<Tip>
  Bookmark the daily digest report and share it in Slack or email. Teams stay aligned on what to fix next without digging through raw logs.
