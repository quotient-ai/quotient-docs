description: 'Instrument agent frameworks with Quotient tracing through OpenInference.'
---

Quotient integrates with popular agent and orchestration frameworks through the OpenInference instrumentation ecosystem. Each integration follows the same pattern:

1. Install the Quotient SDK and the relevant OpenInference instrumentor.
2. Export your `QUOTIENT_API_KEY` (and the provider API keys your agent requires).
3. Initialize the tracer with the instrumentor.
4. Decorate your main entrypoint with `@quotient.trace` (recommended) and run your agent as usual.

Use the guides below for framework-specific setup and sample code:

* [Agno](./agno)
* [OpenAI Agents SDK](./openai-agents-sdk)
* [LangGraph](./langgraph)
* [Smolagents](./smolagents)

Looking for a different framework? Browse the [OpenInference instrumentation repository](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference/tree/main/python/instrumentation) and add the matching instrumentor to the `instruments` list when initializing the tracer.
