description: 'Capture Pinecone index operations in Quotient traces.'
---

## Prerequisites

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install "quotientai>=0.4.6" "pinecone-client" "openinference-instrumentation-pinecone>=0.1.6"
```

Set credentials:

```bash
export PINECONE_API_KEY=your-pinecone-api-key
export QUOTIENT_API_KEY=your-quotient-api-key
```

## Sample Integration

```python trace_pinecone.py
from openinference.instrumentation.pinecone import PineconeInstrumentor
from pinecone import Pinecone

from quotientai import QuotientAI

quotient = QuotientAI()
quotient.tracer.init(
    app_name="pinecone-retrieval",
    environment="dev",
    instruments=[PineconeInstrumentor()],
)

pc = Pinecone()
index = pc.Index("support-index")
response = index.query(vector=[0.1, 0.3, 0.2], top_k=5)
print(response)
```

### Notes

* Spans include namespace, index configuration, counts of IDs processed, and query results.
* Errors during instrumentation are logged but never block your Pinecone operations.
