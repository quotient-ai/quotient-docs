Quotient provides OpenInference instrumentors for popular vector databases. They create spans for CRUD operations and attach metadata that surfaces in the Quotient UI and reports.

Supported databases:

* [Chroma](./chroma)
* [Pinecone](./pinecone)
* [Qdrant](./qdrant)

Each page includes installation steps, environment requirements, and a small example showing how to attach the instrumentor when initializing the tracer. See [Vector Database Instrumentation](../../core-functionalities/traces/vector-database-semantic-conventions) for the full list of emitted attributes.
