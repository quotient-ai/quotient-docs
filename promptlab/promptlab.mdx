# üéØ Human Evals via PromptLab

Welcome to **PromptLab**, your interactive playground for prototyping and testing prompts. With PromptLab, you can experiment with different models, fine-tune your prompts, and evaluate how various configurations affect your AI‚Äôs output.

In this guide, you‚Äôll learn how to set up, test, and improve your prompts using **PromptLab**.

## üìù Getting Started

The first step is accessing the **PromptLab** interface. Follow these steps to begin prototyping your prompts:

### 1. **Choose Your Model**
   - In the left panel labeled **Provider and Model**, select the AI provider and the model you want to work with.
   - For example, you can choose from providers like **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, or others. In this case, we‚Äôve selected **GPT-4** from OpenAI.

### 2. **Adjust Model Parameters**
   - **Temperature**: Adjust this slider to control the randomness of the model‚Äôs responses. A higher value (e.g., 0.8) results in more random outputs, while a lower value (e.g., 0.1) produces more deterministic results.
   - **Maximum Length**: Set the maximum number of tokens the model can generate.
   - **Top P**: Controls the cumulative probability for token sampling. Higher values include more token possibilities in the output.

### 3. **Define Your Prompts**
   - **System Prompt**: Provide instructions to guide the model‚Äôs behavior. This prompt shapes the assistant‚Äôs tone and approach. Example:
     ```txt
     You are an AI customer service assistant.
     ```
   - **User Prompt**: Enter the main user prompt that the model will respond to. For instance:
     ```txt
     Here are the details about a customer‚Äôs order: {context}. Using only the information provided, respond to this inquiry about their order: {input}.
     Be concise and accurate. Avoid inventing information not present in the context.
     ```

### 4. **Input Variables**
   - The panel on the right is where you define **Prompt Variables**.
   - You may use `{input}` and `{context}` as variables to dynamically pass values during prompt execution. This allows for flexibility in testing different inputs.
   - **Note**: If you choose to provide `{context}` in the prompt template, you will have to pass in some context. 

## üöÄ Running Your Prompt

Once you‚Äôve set up your prompt, you‚Äôre ready to run it:

1. Click the **Run** button located at the top right of the interface.
2. Watch how the model processes your input and returns an output based on the system and user prompts you‚Äôve configured.

You can switch between **Manual** and **Dataset** mode to decide how you want to feed inputs into the system.

## üîÑ Iterating and Improving

To get the best performance out of PromptLab, experiment with different configurations and prompt setups. Here are a few strategies to refine your prompts:

### 1. **Test with Different Temperatures**
   - Adjust the **Temperature** setting to explore how randomness impacts the generated responses. Lower values will produce more factual and concise outputs, while higher values generate more creative and varied responses.

### 2. **Use Context and Variables**
   - Try using the **context** and **input** variables creatively to test how well the model incorporates dynamic content into responses.
   - Example input: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the status of my order?‚Äù

### 3. **Save Runs to Dataset**
   - Toggle the **Save runs to dataset** switch if you want to track and store all your test runs for future evaluation or comparison.

## üß† Advanced Features

PromptLab offers more advanced features to help you refine your AI models:

### **Model Switching**
   Quickly switch between different models and providers to see how each handles the same prompt differently. This helps you choose the most suitable model for your use case.

### **Real-Time Prompt Tuning**
   As you modify your prompt, **PromptLab** instantly adjusts and previews the changes, giving you real-time feedback on the effectiveness of your prompt edits.

## üí° Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Ensure your prompts are clear and well-defined to avoid ambiguity in the AI‚Äôs responses.
- **Iterate**: Test multiple configurations to determine the most effective prompt setup for your model.
