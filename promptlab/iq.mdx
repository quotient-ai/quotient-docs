# Quotient IQ: Intelligent Prompt Optimization

Welcome to **Quotient IQ**, your intelligent copilot for prompt creation and optimization. With IQ, you can easily create effective prompts and continuously improve them through an iterative feedback loop powered by AI. This documentation will guide you through the complete process of using IQ, from crafting your initial prompt to saving an optimized final version.

## üìã Workflow Overview

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide on how to use IQ to improve your prompts:

1. **Create the initial user prompt**
2. **Fill in prompt variables**
3. **Run the generation and review the completion**
4. **Provide feedback**
5. **IQ suggests improvements**
6. **Accept or reject the changes**
7. **Run the new prompt and observe improvements**
8. **Save the optimized prompt**

## üìù Step 1: Create the Initial User Prompt

The first step in using IQ is to create an initial **user prompt**. This prompt serves as a template that defines the instructions given to the AI. You can include placeholder variables that will later be replaced by actual input data.

For example:

```plaintext
You are an AI assistant trained to help sales agents respond effectively to customer objections. Your role is to generate clear, persuasive, and empathetic responses that address customer concerns while highlighting the value of the product or service.
[Customer Objection]: {input}

---

## üîÑ Step 2: Fill in the Prompt Variables

Next, fill in the prompt variables. Variables allow you to insert dynamic content into your prompts, making it more flexible and reusable. This is especially useful when working with large datasets or varied inputs.

### Example:
In this case, `{input}` is the variable where you‚Äôll enter a customer objection.

```plaintext
{input}: "The product is way too expensive!"
```

Run the prompt with the filled-in variables by clicking `Run`.

## ü§ñ Step 3: Run the Generation and Review the Completion

Once you run the prompt, the model generates a **completion** based on the provided input. Review the completion to determine whether it aligns with your expectations.

If the completion is satisfactory, you can move to the next step. If not, you‚Äôll provide feedback on what the AI could do better.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Step 4: Provide Feedback

Should your response fall short of what you were expecting, you can provide feedback directly in the IQ interface. Your feedback can highlight areas where the completion fell short or suggest how it could be improved. For example, if the response didn‚Äôt adequately address the customer‚Äôs concerns, you might leave a comment like:

```plaintext
This completion doesn‚Äôt address the pain point enough.
```

IQ will take this feedback into account and suggest improvements to the prompt. 

**Note**:

- IQ only considers negative feedback on the response. If the response is satisfactory, that's great! However, there won't be an option to provide additional feedback in such cases.

---

## üí° Step 5: IQ Suggests Prompt Improvements

Based on the feedback, IQ will automatically recommend changes to the prompt. These changes are designed to optimize the prompt and improve the quality of the AI-generated responses.

The suggested changes might include improving clarity, focusing more on addressing the customer‚Äôs specific objection, or modifying the structure of the prompt.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 6: Accept or Reject the Suggested Changes

After reviewing the suggested improvements, you have two options:

- **Accept**: If you like the changes IQ suggested, click **Accept changes**, and the prompt will be updated accordingly.
- **Reject**: If you prefer your original prompt, click **Reject**, and it will revert to the previous version.

This step allows you to maintain control over your prompt while benefiting from IQ‚Äôs intelligent suggestions.

---

## üöÄ Step 7: Run the Updated Prompt

Once you‚Äôve accepted the changes, run the updated prompt again to observe how the AI's responses have improved. IQ ensures a continuous cycle of improvement by iterating on feedback.

Keep testing, refining, and adjusting your prompts to reach the best possible performance.

---

## üíæ Step 8: Save the Optimized Prompt

Once you're satisfied with the changes, save your optimized prompt. You can do this by clicking **Save new version**. This version is now stored for future use, ensuring that you have a well-optimized prompt ready for similar tasks.

## üîç Best Practices for Using IQ

Here are some best practices to follow when using IQ:

- **Be specific in your feedback**: The more specific your feedback, the better IQ can optimize your prompt.
- **Use variables creatively**: Variables allow you to create flexible prompts that adapt to various contexts, making them more reusable.
- **Test iteratively**: Keep running and refining your prompt based on real-world scenarios to achieve the most effective results.
