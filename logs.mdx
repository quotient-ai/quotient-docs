You can use Quotient's SDK to log inputs and outputs from your retrieval or search-augmented AI applications.

# Initialize the Logger

Initialize the Quotient logger with configuration settings for your application:

<CodeGroup>
    ```python logging.py
    from quotientai import QuotientAI

    quotient = QuotientAI(api_key="your-quotient-api-key")

    logger = quotient.logger.init(
        app_path="my-first-app",
        environment="dev",
    )
    ```

    ```typescript logging.ts
    import { QuotientAI } from "quotientai";

    const quotient = new QuotientAI({ apiKey: "your-quotient-api-key" });

    const logger = quotient.logger.init({
        appName: "my-first-app",
        environment: "dev",
    });
    ```
</CodeGroup>

### Parameters:

<ParamField path="app_name" type="string" required>
    Name of your application. Core parameter used to identify the source of logs in the Quotient dashboard.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="environment" type="string" required>
    Environment where your application is running (e.g., "dev", "staging", "prod"). Core parameter used to help segregate logs by deployment environment.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="tags" type="object">
    Key-value pairs for categorizing and filtering logs. Useful for slicing analytics by dimensions like customer, feature, model version, etc.
    
    **Example:** `{"model": "gpt-4", "feature": "customer-support"}`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="sample_rate" type="float" default="1.0">
    Value that determines what percent of logs to persist. Valid range of 0.0 to 1.0.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="hallucination_detection" type="boolean" default="false">
    Enable automatic detection of potential hallucinations in model outputs.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="hallucination_detection_sample_rate" type="float" default="0.0">
    Value that determines what percent of logs to run hallucination detection on. Valid range of 0.0 to 1.0.
</ParamField>


### Returns:
<ResponseField name="QuotientLogger" type="object">
    A QuotientLogger object.
</ResponseField>


# Send Logs

Log model interactions with context and metadata for analysis.

<CodeGroup>
    ```python logging.py
    log_id = logger.log(
        user_query="How do I cook a goose?",
        model_output="The capital of France is Paris",
        documents=["Here is an excellent goose recipe..."]
    )
    ```

    ```typescript logging.ts
    const logId = await logger.log({
        userQuery: "How do I cook a goose?",
        modelOutput: "The capital of France is Paris",
        documents: ["Here is an excellent goose recipe..."]
    });
    ```
</CodeGroup>

### Parameters:

<ParamField path="user_query" type="string" required>
    The input query or prompt sent to the model.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="model_output" type="string" required>
    The response generated by the model.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="documents" type="array" required>
    List of document contents used as context for the model. Can be strings or dictionaries with `page_content` and optional `metadata`.

    Used in hallucination detection and attribution analysis.

    If a dictionary is passed, it must have the key `page_content`, containing the document text, and optionally `metadata` , containing any document metadata you want to capture about the document.

    Example:
    ```
    [
        "Sample Document 1 without metadata",
        {"page_content": "Sample Document 2 with metadata", "metadata": {"source": "google.com"},
        {"page_content": "Sample Document 3 without metadata"}
    ]
    ```

    **NOTE:** One of `documents`, `message_history`, or `instructions` is required.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="message_history" type="array">
    Previous messages in the conversation, following the OpenAI message format with `role` and `content` keys.

    Used in hallucination detection and attribution analysis.

    **Example:**
    ```
    [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert on geography."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The capital of France is Paris"}
    ]
    ```

    **NOTE:** One of `documents`, `message_history`, or `instructions` is required.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="instructions" type="array">
    List of instructions provided to the model.

    Used in hallucination detection and attribution analysis.

    **Example:**
    ```
    [
        "You are a helpful assistant that answers questions about the world.",
        "Answer the question in a concise manner. If you are not sure, say 'I don't know'."
    ]
    ```
    **NOTE:** One of `documents`, `message_history`, or `instructions` is required.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="tags" type="object" required="false">
    Additional tags to associate with each log entry.

    **Example:** `{"model": "gpt-4", "feature": "customer-support"}`
</ParamField>

### Returns:

<ResponseField name="log_id" type="string">
    A UUID representing the unique identifier for the logged event.
</ResponseField>

# Asynchronous Python client

You can also use the asynchronous Python client to log data and retrieve logs.

<CodeGroup>
    ```python logging.py
    from quotientai import AsyncQuotientAI

    quotient = AsyncQuotientAI(api_key="your-quotient-api-key")

    logger = quotient.logger.init(
        app_path="my-first-app",
        environment="dev",
        sample_rate=1.0,
        hallucination_detection=True,
        hallucination_detection_sample_rate=1.0,
    )
    
    log_id = await logger.log(
        user_query="How do I cook a goose?",
        model_output="The capital of France is Paris",
        documents=["Here is an excellent goose recipe..."]
    )

    logs = await quotient.logs.list()
    print(logs)
    ```
